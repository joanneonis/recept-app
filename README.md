## Recept app (School assignment)
in combination with angularfire

# App
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) 

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Note that the service worker does not work with ng-serve, this can be tested at my live url: [recept app](receptenapp-fe43f.firebaseapp.com/recepten) or build and run this with a webserver

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
